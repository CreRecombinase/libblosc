===============================================================
 Announcing C-Blosc 1.12.1
 A blocking, shuffling and lossless compression library for C
===============================================================

What is new?
============

Backported BloscLZ parameters that were fine-tuned for C-Blosc2.
You should expect better compression ratios and faster operation,
specially on modern CPUs.  See:
http://blosc.org/posts/blosclz-tuning/

For more info, please see the release notes in:

https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.rst


What is it?
===========

Blosc (http://www.blosc.org) is a high performance meta-compressor
optimized for binary data.  It has been designed to transmit data to
the processor cache faster than the traditional, non-compressed,
direct memory fetch approach via a memcpy() OS call.

Blosc has internal support for different compressors like its internal
BloscLZ, but also LZ4, LZ4HC, Snappy and Zlib.  This way these can
automatically leverage the multithreading and pre-filtering
(shuffling) capabilities that comes with Blosc.
